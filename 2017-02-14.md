##Incoterms:
- I'm getting more comfortable with Symfony's form builder and custom form types, thanks to stories like this. Managing prototype form elements is still a pain, especially compared to just using HTML form elements and/or the kind of actions available via a JS framework but it's at least nicely tied to an entity and controller in the end.

- There's more to do in terms of validating the terms and ensuring that there are no duplicates but validation as a whole needs to be considered in more detail.

##Product Grouping:
- Fixed an issue that Jon pointed out re: a potential security hole. The issue was that the full window href was being passed across as a route parameter, making it a prime subject for an attack based on hijacking that value to return the user to an unsafe location. We closed it by setting the base url for the app within its config and then passing the query string into the template via the Search controller and out again through the JSRouting system. This means that the entire URL is never passed around and that the most crucial parts are constructed within the controller before triggering the redirect, giving us greater control over it.

- TL:DR - it isn't safe to pass a full URL around from the client to the server. Get the small parts you need and build it away from prying eyes and idle hands.

##Thoughts:
- I think I'd really like to add a rule to PHPStorm that squawks at me every time I use `array()` instead of []. Right now, it's hard to keep that consistent as so much documentation uses the former and it's easy to write when my brain is on autopilot.
