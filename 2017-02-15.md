##Price bandings
- Built the settings page to be allow for user-defined bandings. Doing it with Symfony forms is a real hassle that I'd like to get better at. Right now, because there's only one setting to be updated, it's its own custom entity that could eventually be absorved by a settings collection.

- Tied the above into the rest of the price banding logic that Jon has been working on. This required updating a few existing tests and adding the price boundary entity in at the right point. Main takeaway is to aim to do that at the point at which a method is called so that, when unit testing, you can mock / retrieve the entity without having to do anything complicated with the entitymanager.

- Added a bit of styling to show the relevant icons based on a product row's price banding. Working with material iicons in this way was a bit tricky and, given the time constraints, I had to rely on some nasty !important positioning.

##VueJS
- We set up a generic Vue app (using Vuepack) with an entry point on the search page. The next step is to add the app id to the table element and replace its content with a new Vue component. This is my first time injecting a Vue applet into a larger page so it'll be interesting to see how that looks & feels.

##Extras
- Enabled a PHPStorm plugin that recommends hotkeys every time you use the mouse to perform an action. It's annoying but I've already picked up a few new useful commands and created some more keybindings for myself.
